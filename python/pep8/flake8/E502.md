E502
    The backslash is redundant between brackets

There is no need for backslashes between brackets.

Anti-pattern
```python
print('Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought '\
      'forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived '\
      'in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that '\
      '"all men are created equal."')
```

Best practice
```python
print('Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought '
      'forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived '
      'in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that '
      '"all men are created equal."')
```
